# TherapyAI
This is a project for the course "Machine learning using Colab" 
## Project description
This is a collection of notebooks that were used to fine-tune a FLAN-T5 model to better suit summarization tasks. Then the final model was used in a web app TherapyAI as a conversation summarizer. It will help by reducing the number of tokens used per call and information recall. 
The chat interface is built using Streamlit. The chat model is OpenAI's GPT-3.5B turbo. The summarization model is a fine-tuned T5 model running locally on the server.

More to come soon...
